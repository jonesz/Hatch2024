# A Review of the Genes.

I, computer scientist, skimmed the wikipedia page for all of these.

* MTHFR  = Folate.
* CYP1A2 = Caffeine, aflatoxin B1, and paracemtol; metabolizes to cacenogenic intermediates.
* CYP2E1 = Metabolizes ethanol, acetone, and acetal; related to cigarettes.
* FADS1  = Eicosapentaenoic Acid / Arachidonic Acid
* SOD2   = Transforms toxic superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and diatomic oxygen.
* BCMO1  = Vitamin A / beta-carotene
* SLC2A2 = Protein facilitated glucose movement.
* PPARG  = Regulator of adipocyte differentiation.
* GSTP1  = Detoxification, Glutathione
* PCSK9  = Cholestorol, LDL
* UGT1A1 = Transfer of small lipophilic molecules.
* NR1I2  = Determines the presence of foreign toxins; activated by dexamethasone and rifampicin.

Selected VITAMINS for our optimization;

VITAMIN B,  VITAMIN A, VITAMIN C
FOLATE, BETA-CAROTENE, ASCORBIC ACID

We've gathered that genes affect the proficiency of a person's ability to operate metabolically.
